## 🛡 What is this?

This project is a **full-stack automated web application penetration-testing engine**.

It does not just crawl pages — it:
- Discovers the application’s **attack surface**
- Finds **real exploitable vulnerabilities**
- Proves them using payload injection
- Classifies their **risk**
- And generates **professional pentest reports** (HTML & PDF)

This simulates how real **red-teamers and bug-bounty hunters** analyze targets.

| SQL Injection (SQLi) | ✅ |
| Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) | ✅ |
| Broken Access Control (IDOR) | ✅ |
| Hidden JavaScript endpoints | ✅ |
| Parameter fuzzing | ✅ |
| Risk scoring (LOW → CRITICAL) | ✅ |
| Exploit proof | ✅ |
| HTML & PDF pentest reports | ✅ |

## 🧠 How it works

The engine runs in multiple automated phases:

1. **Endpoint Crawler**  
   Crawls internal pages and builds a list of reachable endpoints.

2. **JavaScript Miner**  
   Extracts hidden API routes and endpoints from JS files.

3. **Attack Surface Mapper**  
   Tags endpoints as HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW risk.

4. **Parameter Fuzzer**  
   Injects common parameter names (`id`, `user`, `q`, etc.) into endpoints.

5. **Parameter Discovery**  
   Detects which parameters are actually accepted by the backend.

6. **Exploit Engine**  
   Actively tests:
   - SQL Injection  
   - XSS  
   - IDOR (Broken Access Control)

7. **Risk Engine**  
   Scores vulnerabilities based on:
   - Endpoint sensitivity  
   - Exploit type  

8. **Pentest Report Generator**  
   Creates:
   - `report.html`
   - `pentest_report.pdf`  
   containing vulnerabilities, payloads, evidence, and severity.

**DVWA Target Environment**  
This intentionally vulnerable web application (Damn Vulnerable Web App) was used to validate the scanner in a controlled and legal security-testing environment. It simulates real-world web application flaws for training and research.

</div>

**Automated Vulnerability Discovery & Risk Scoring**  
The engine identified multiple SQL Injection, XSS, and IDOR vulnerabilities and automatically classified them into CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, and LOW risk categories based on exploitability and impact.

</div>

**Exploit Proof with Payloads & Server Evidence**  
Every finding is backed by the exact payload used and the server response confirming the vulnerability, eliminating false positives and providing reproducible proof of exploitation.

</div>

**Live Exploit Engine in Action**  
The scanner actively fuzzes parameters, injects payloads, detects vulnerabilities, and validates access-control flaws in real time using a multithreaded attack pipeline.

## 📄 Example Output

The tool produces **real pentest-style reports** with:

- Executive summary  
- Total issues  
- Risk distribution  
- Vulnerable endpoints  
- Parameters  
- Payloads  
- Server response evidence  

This matches the format used by:
- Burp Suite  
- Nessus  
- Acunetix  
- Pentest consulting firms
